This file explains everything we'll be creating.
First, we create a simple html file, named index.html
Secondly, we use our snippet to create a simple html markup, which can be done by simply pressing '!' then 'enter' button on your keyboard
Thirdly, we can create a simple img folder where we'll import our loader to, which will be used for the loan calculator in the user experience.
Fourthly, download the loader.gif from google and save it in the img folder as we ahve done.
Fifthly, go to getbootstrap and then go to getting started, and then scroll to starter template and copy all and then paste it in your index.html file, replacing the snippet we already created, meaning that number step two above in not necessary.
